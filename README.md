# Hadoop Platform and Application Framework  
This project is based on a course offered by UC San Diego Supercomputer center for their Big Data Specialization certificate on Coursera. The course covers Hadoop Basics, Hadoop stack, Hadoop Distributed File System, Map/Reduce and Spark.

Week 1:
  - Big Data Hadoop Stack
  - Hands-On Exploration of the Cloudera VM

Week 2: 
  - Overview of the Hadoop Stack
  - The Hadoop Execution Environment
  - Overview of Hadoop based Applications and Services

Week 3: 
  - HDFS Architecture and Configuration
  - HDFS Performance and Tuning
  - HDFS Access, Commands, APIs, and Applications

Week 4:
  - Introduction to Map/Reduce
  - Map/Reduce Examples and Principles

Week 5:
  - Introduction to Apache Spark
  - Resilient Distributed Datasets and Transformations
  - Job scheduling, Actions, Caching and Shared Variables

In Week 4 of the course, we discuss the [Map/Reduce](https://github.com/gilbertosg/hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/MapReduce) framework with two exercises in Hadoop streaming using Python:
  - [Wordcount](https://github.com/gilbertosg/hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/MapReduce/wordcount-assignment)
  - [Joining Data](https://github.com/gilbertosg/hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/MapReduce/joining-data-assignment)
    * [Join 1](https://github.com/gilbertosg/hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/MapReduce/joining-data-assignment/simple-join)
    * [Join 2](https://github.com/juliaawu/coursera-hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/MapReduce/joining-data-assignment/advanced-join)

Week 5 covers the [Spark](https://github.com/gilbertosg/hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/spark) framework with two join exercises using spark.
  - [Simple Join](https://github.com/gilbertosg/hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/spark/simple-join-assignment)
  - [Advanced Join](https://github.com/juliaawu/hadoop-platform-and-application-framework/tree/master/spark/advanced-join-assignment)
